# Equation Formatter

## Overview
Equation Formatter is a React-based web application that allows users to input, preview, and format mathematical equations using LaTeX. The app provides a seamless experience for working with mathematical expressions in a visually appealing way.

## Features
- **Live LaTeX Equation Rendering**: Enter equations and see them rendered in real-time.
- **Equation History**: View previously entered equations.
- **Theme Selection**: Switch between different UI themes.
- **Smooth Animations**: Powered by Framer Motion.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Easily accessible via GitHub Pages.
- **LaTeX Guide**: Provides users with a reference for LaTeX syntax and equation formatting.
- **Export Equations**: Save formatted equations as images or LaTeX code.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easily copy LaTeX equations for use in other applications.
- **Download Equations**: Download formatted equations as PNG or SVG files.

## Installation

## Example Equations
Try these LaTeX equations in the app:
```latex
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
$$\int_a^b f(x) \,dx = F(b) - F(a)$$
$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$
```

## Build
